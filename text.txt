Anarchism-means the liberation of the human mind from the power of religion, the liberation of the human body from the power of things, the liberation from the shackles and prohibitions of government, it means a social order based on the freedom of assembly of people. The thought was pure, simple, true, it inspired me, it ignited a rebellious spirit, but in the end I learned the same lesson as Goldaman, Proudhon and many others, true freedom requires sacrifice and a lot of pain, most people only think that they want freedom, but in fact they seek the bonds of social order, strict laws, materialism.
